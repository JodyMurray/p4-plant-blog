                    <h2 class="text-center">How to Care for Your Houseplants in Winter</h2>
                    <br>
                    <h4>1: Increase Light</h4>
                    <p>
                        If it feels like we rarely see the sun in the winter, that's because it sets earlier, is lower
                        in
                        the
                        sky, and is often covered with clouds. Make sure your houseplants are getting enough light
                        during
                        this
                        time. Most plants will adjust to the seasonal change in their current spot, while others might
                        need
                        to
                        be moved closer to their light source, the window, to receive more light. If plants are visibly
                        leaning
                        towards the window, gradually rotate them every few days to help them straighten out. If plants
                        have
                        spindly new growth, move them closer to the sill. You can also consider adding some supplemental
                        lighting to your space with a grow light.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>2: Be Mindful of Temperature</h4>
                    <p>
                        An extreme change in temperature, or draft of cold or warm air, can cause indoor plants, used to
                        somewhat stable conditions, to stress out. Keep your plants away from open windows and front
                        doors, as well as heating units and radiators (which can quickly dry them out). Some plants are
                        more sensitive to the cold than others bu if you're feeling the chill, chances are, your plant
                        is too. Most common houseplants prefer temps around 23°C.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>3: Move Them Closer to a Window</h4>
                    <p>
                        Shorter days mean fewer hours of sunlight. Help your plants maximise the day's rays by moving
                        them a bit closer to a window.
                        You won't need to worry about winter sun scorching them.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>4: Don't stress about dropped leaves</h4>
                    <p>Most plants are sleeping now, which means they're conserving as much energy as possible. That
                        means they may drop some leaves, because they don't need them.
                        This is nothing to worry about and there's nothing you need to do. Don't be tempted to water
                        more or feed them. It will do more harm than good.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>5: Embrace Dormancy</h4>
                    <p>Feel sleepy in winter? Plants do too—thanks to shorter days and less sun. Plants can go into a
                        state of dormancy or semi-dormancy in the winter months. And since plants only take up water
                        based on the amount of light they receive, this will change how much you should water your
                        plants. You will find yourself watering less often than you did in the summer growing season.
                        For most plants, you will want to wait until the potting soil has dried out complete before
                        watering again. You can also wait for visible signs of thirst to show, like wrinkling leaves for
                        succulents or drooping stems for tropicals, paired with bone dry soil.
